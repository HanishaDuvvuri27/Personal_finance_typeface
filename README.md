# Personal Finance 

Personal Finance is a full-stack web application that allows users to track and categorize their expenses. It provides manual and OCR-based receipt entry, analytics, and user authentication.

## Features

### 🔒 Authentication
- User registration and login (JWT-based).
- Auth middleware to protect private routes.

### 💸 Expense Tracking
- Add expenses manually via form.
- Upload receipts (images or PDFs) to auto-extract merchant name, date, and amount using Tesseract.js OCR.
- Transactions are stored and linked to users.

### 📊 Analytics
- Track total expenses, income, and top categories.
- Visual summary on dashboard.

### 📂 Categories
- Auto-tagging of transactions into default categories like Food, Shopping, Travel, etc.
- Manual category adjustments.

### 📤 Upload System
- OCR parser reads receipt content (not filenames).
- Fallback default: Adds a dummy transaction (Flipkart, ₹2198, Shopping, current date) if no data extracted.
